### Overview of the Replication Package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

```
./
    |--- dataset/     		  The full dataset of ROS-based systems mined from GitHub and the scripts used to extract the data.
    |--- data_analysis/       	  Mining scripts and spreadsheets used in the manual data analysis.
    |--- ECSA_2021.pdf            (not available yet)  A copy of the paper in pdf format.
```

Each of the folders listed above are described in details in the remaining of this readme.

#### Mining the Data

All the explanation of executing dataset building scripts is in the folder [readme](https://github.com/S2-group/msr-2021-green-practices-replication-package/blob/main/dataset_building/README.md).

            |--- git_repos_data.json                   Markdown files and code comments (we still need to upload this to MongoDB).
       |--- output_data/                               JSON files (for each collection) containing data points with energy-related terms.
       |--- energy_mining.py                           Mining code that searches for energy-related.
       |--- gen_csv.sh				       Code that generates the CSV file from extracted JSONs.

### Data Analysis

The data in the CSV files has been manually, collaboratively, and iteratively extracted by the authors of the paper.
