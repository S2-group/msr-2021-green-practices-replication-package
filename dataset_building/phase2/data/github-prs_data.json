Let's say we are running an instance of ekf_localization_node on some device in the ground plane, and we wanted to know the position of the wall robot w.r.t. the ground plane. If we turn on relative mode, we take the wall vehicle's world frame X-Y position (and remember that since it started sideways, its X-Y plane is the wall itself), and \"removes\" its initial X-Y position.

When we take the difference, we get 0 (correct), but then if we apply the transform to the ground plane device running the EKF, it adds 90 again.", "If the IMU were to always report its orientation data w.r.t. its world frame when the robot started, the method I have would work: if the robot on the wall turned so it was driving straight up the wall, its world frame ", " should be 90.
